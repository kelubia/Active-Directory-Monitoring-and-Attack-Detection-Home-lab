## 💡 What’s This All About?
This is a **hands-on Active Directory Monitoring & Attack Detection Lab**, designed to help you:
✅ Learn and practice AD security monitoring  
✅ Detect malicious activity like a cyber ninja 🥷  
✅ Test SIEM, EDR, and detection tools without blowing up a corporate network

## 🛠 Architecture & Lab Setup
![Lab Architecture](diagrams/ad_lab_architecture.png)

This lab includes:
- **Domain Controller (Windows Server)**
- **Attacker Machine (Kali Linux / Metasploit)**
- **SIEM (ELK, Splunk, or Wazuh)**
- **EDR Agent**
- **Monitoring Dashboard (Grafana)**

---

## ✨ Features & Capabilities
🔍 **Real-time AD log monitoring**  
🤖 **AI-powered anomaly detection (optional ML integration)**  
📊 **Interactive dashboards (Grafana/ELK)**  
⚔ **Simulated attacks (Kerberoasting, Pass-the-Hash, etc.)**  
🧠 **Security benchmarks comparing lab results to real-world attack data**

---

## 🔧 Tech Stack
- **Windows Server 2019/2022 (Domain Controller)**
- **Kali Linux (Attacker)**
- **Python (log parsing, anomaly detection)**
- **Splunk / ELK / Wazuh (SIEM)**
- **Grafana (Dashboards)**

---

## 📚 How to Use It (Tutorial)
1. Clone this repo:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Active-Directory-Monitoring-Lab.git
   ```
2. Follow the `setup_guide.md` for step-by-step installation.
3. Run the Python scripts to simulate AD events:
   ```bash
   python3 simulate_events.py
   ```

## 📊 Simulation vs. Reality Benchmark
| Attack Type       | Simulated Detection Time | Real-World Average |
|-------------------|-------------------------|--------------------|
| Kerberoasting     | 2.3 sec                 | 15 min             |
| Pass-the-Hash     | 3.8 sec                 | 20 min             |
